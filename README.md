# üïπÔ∏è Character Card Creator

A small personal project developed to advance my skills in **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This application allows users to create and customize a mini-avatar, define its name and catchphrase, apply different visual themes, and download the final profile as a stylized character card.
It also features a distinct retro aesthetic inspired by CRT monitors and vintage tech.
